## Usage
A movie search engine is a web application or platform that allows users to search for movies based on various criteria such as title, genre, release year, actors, directors, and more.

Key features of a movie search engine may include:

Keyword search: Users can enter keywords in a search bar to find movies that match their search terms. This could include movie titles, actors, directors, and even plot points.
